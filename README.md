# Culex_population_ML
Machine learning for predictive forecasting Culex populations in Collier County.

## Tl;dr

* Culex nigripalpus is the most important vector of West Nile virus in Collier County, Florida. 
* Understanding the seasonal and long-term population trends of Culex nigripalpus is vital to reduce the risk of human infection. 
* Here, I explore the utility in predictive modeling to forecast Culex nigripalpus populations in Collier County, Florida.
