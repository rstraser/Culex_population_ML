# Predictive modeling of West Nile virus vector Culex nigripalpus using climate and surveillance data

Culex nigripalus is one of the most prominent mosquito species in Southwest Florida. Given the tropical climate of the region, Cx. nigripalpus has the potential to reach high numbers across the the county, particularly during the summer season when local preciptation is highest. Using machine learning tools to forecast resident populations of Culex nigripalus in Collier County, Florida.

## Tl;dr

* Culex nigripalpus is the most important vector of West Nile virus in Collier County, Florida. 
* Understanding the seasonal and long-term population trends of Culex nigripalpus is vital to reduce the risk of human infection. 
* Here, I explore the utility in predictive modeling to forecast Culex nigripalpus populations in Collier County, Florida.
